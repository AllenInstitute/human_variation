This repo contains links to processed data and code for reproducing analyses in the [manuscript on bioRxiv](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.10.07.511366v1.full): "Inter-individual genomic and transcriptomic variation in human cortical cell types" (Johansen, Somasundaram, et al).  The repo is under construction, but will continue to be updated with scripts used to generate the figures in this manuscript in the near future.

Processed data will be hosted on CELLxGENE (link to be provided here ~November 2022)
